    <h1>Learn the rubiks cube </h1>

    <p>Solving the Rubik's cube is an incredible feeling. At the biggining you will keep getting faster and cross new barriers you never thougt you would get to. I belive that anyone <br />
        can solve a Rubik's cube, so I compiled a list of the resourses I used, and the resourses I wish I used so that anyone can kickstart their journey! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>

    <h2>Learn to solve</h2>
    <p>This is the fist step in your journey, this can be done in a few hours, and you will feel great after. <br />
        To first learn you only really need one video. I pesonally learned with Jperm's video, and I belive it is the best.
    </p>

    <p> while I belive this is the best video, if you want to try a different way Cube Head's tutorial is also great. <br />
        The methods are quite simmalar, but having another person explain it may make it easier </p>

    <h2>Getting faster</h2>
    <p>Now that you can solve the cube, you may be wanting to get faster. When you show your friends you don't want to bore them. Below are 2 videos (one from Jperm and one from Cube Head)
        for getting faster with the cube.<br /> First Jperm's guide </p>

    <p>Now the one from Cube Head</p>
    <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir3BkmVePNQ?list=PLqrfspOsG9B9xufGrDYqDAFKU65EkZYcF" title="Solve the Rubik&#39;s Cube UNDER 60 SECONDS!

    <h2>Begginer CFOP (Simmalar to the method the advancced cubers use</h2>
    <p>CFOP is your key into the "real" cubing world. CFOP stands for Cross (the white thing at the biggining of your solve). First 2 layers (you solve them at the same time). <br />
        OLL (orient last layer, making all the yellow peices face up). And finnaly PLL (permute last layer, taking all of the last layer and putting the peices in the right spot) <br />
        In order to do this, you must know cube notation, Cube Head explains notation in this video
    </p>

    <p>Now that you know cube notation, there will be a video for each step, starting with the cross</p>

    <p>F2L is probably the hardet part of CFOP, and let me tell you, at the biggening, you will be slower, but in the long run. this is also the one that pays off the most</p>

    <p>The last layer is different than what we did until now, this part is mainly remembering algarithems, good luck!</p>

    <p>FINAL STRECH!!! you are almost done with CFOP, just the PLL left. Soon you will know CFOP</p>
    <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC9nwou59ow?list=PLqrfspOsG9B-zqJu9f-45BZRamipy-q2y" title="2 Look PLL | Beginner CFOP" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>After you know CFOP, you are already so close to sub-30! This video should give you the final kick to get there</p>
    <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ULKZ1dZs04?list=PLqrfspOsG9B-zqJu9f-45BZRamipy-q2y" title="10 Tips to Solve the Rubik&#39;s Cube in 30 Seconds!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />

    
    <p><b>Note</b> <br /> I personaly recomend going to competitions, even if you solve "slow". WCA compotions are open to anyone. It is very fun to go to them and find new friends in the cubing comunity.<br />
        If you are interested in competing you can go to the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions?" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"> World Cubing Association's website</a>. There are plenty of comps around the world, including in israel.
